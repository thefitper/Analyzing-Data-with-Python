 partially use some of data for train and testing.
 like 70%/30%
 
 #Function train_test_split()
 randomly splits a dataset into training and testing subsets
 from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
 
 x_train,x_test,y_train,y_test = train_test_split(x_data,y_data, test_size=0.3,random_state=0)
 
 use cross validation,
 
 #Functino cross_val_score()
 scores = cross_val_score(lr,x_data,y_data,cv=3)
 
 overfitting , underfitting and model selection.
 -how to pick the best polynomial function.
 
 underfitting = too many noise
 more orderring cause overfitting. (too flexible to data)
